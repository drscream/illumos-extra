To update gcc, perform the following steps:

1) Do a stock build of smartos-live
2) Move the proto area aside and clobber the repo
3) Copy the buildstamp from the set aside proto area into the root of
   the new porto area.
4) git clone -b il-4_4_4 https://github.com/illumos/gcc.git new-gcc
5) Ensure you are on the correct branch (il-4_4_4)
6) Make sure the differences in files between the clone and the current
   source match what you expect.
7) Create a git archive by running something like:

	cd new-gcc; git archive --prefix=gcc-4.4.4/ -o ../gcc-4.4.4.tar.gz HEAD

8) Build the workspace with a new gcc
9) Use wsdiff to compare chunks of the illumos binaries to gain
   confidence in the updated compiler.
